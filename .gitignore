#   According to pypa/pipenv#598, it is recommended to include Pipfile.lock in version control.
#   However, in case of collaboration, if have platform-specific dependencies, which can result
# in a lot of merge conflicts.
#   Choose the option that suits you best.
# Pipfile.lock

# poetry
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include poetry.lock in version control.
#   This is especially recommended for binary packages to ensure reproducibility, and is more
a
#   matter of policy for libraries.
#   Again, choose the option that suits you best.
# poetry.lock

# pdm
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include pdm.lock in version control.
# pdm.lock
#   pdm stores its virtual environment in .pdm-python, which should be ignored.
